# ZipCracker üîêüí•

**ZipCracker** is a Python-based GUI tool designed to perform brute-force password recovery on ZIP and RAR archives. This tool offers configurable character sets, wordlist support, and multi-threaded cracking with an intuitive Tkinter interface. It even lets you cancel long operations on the fly! ‚ö°Ô∏èüöÄ

## Features ‚ú®

- **User-Friendly GUI:** Enjoy a sleek, Tkinter-based interface.
- **Customizable Character Sets:** Choose lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters when not using a wordlist.
- **Wordlist Support:** Use your own wordlists to attempt passwords.
- **Multi-processing:** Leverage multiple CPU cores to speed up brute-force attempts.
- **Automatic Extraction:** Upon success, the archive is extracted into a dedicated folder.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with the appropriate Python dependencies).

## Requirements üì¶

- **Python 3.6+**
- [pyzipper](https://pypi.org/project/pyzipper/) (for encrypted ZIP archives)
- [rarfile](https://pypi.org/project/rarfile/) (for RAR archives)  
  > **Note:** On some systems, `rarfile` may require [UnRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm) installed and available in your system's PATH.

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pyzipper rarfile
```
